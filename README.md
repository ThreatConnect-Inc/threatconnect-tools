# ThreatConnect Tools

This repository gives ThreatConnect customers the ability to create and share various tools they've created for use with their instance of ThreatConnect. Our hope for this repo is that it will:

+ Help promote usage of ThreatConnect via a community of developers,
+ Help customers identify new use cases, and
+ Give new customers the opportunity to learn from existing customers.

This Repository is public. However, contributions will be accepted only from identified ThreatConnect customers. The ThreatConnect Support Team will validate each contribution request before they are published within the Repository, as well as enforce certain formatting requirements.

> **Please Note**: the Support Team will not validate code for functionality or security.

## Guidelines

+ All tools must have their own README.md files.
  + Tool README.md should include the following headers:
    + Summary
    + App Dependencies
    + Use Cases (Optional)
+ Tools should be included in unique, separate folders.
